                <p>From <a href="http://econtact.ca/3_4/HistoricalApproach.htm">Soundscapes: A Historical Approach</a></p>
<p>Sound not only controls space and memory, but the routine that brings about these sounds themselves. It is a feedback loop, to a degree. The sound of the bars vs the sound of the factories. "Let's stay with Week-End. It reflected the transition from a working day to a holiday, Sunday in the open air with the languor so far removed from the return to work on Monday." Art Remus, etc. What do sounds signify? It must be more than order. It is. It is a complexity of values and emotions.</p>
<p>"However, one of Schaeffer's particular obsessions was to create a "solfa of sound objects" in his Traité des objets musicaux, to recognise these objects as realities which could be abstracted beyond the "sound-producing body" which generated them. This explains his anger when one listener, upon hearing his Étude des chemins de fer, remained on the surface, delving no deeper than a recognition - still possible - of the whistling of a locomotive or its clattering on the tracks." -- NEED TRAIN SOUNDS of Specific Trains!</p>
<p>At the same time I create rhythm, I want to throw the listener off.</p>
<p>R. Murray Schafer shines through my research more than I considered: his goal was ethical - to create and preserve acoustic environments. Am I not doing the same thing here? Imagine a soundscape that instead of categorically preserving sounds, told a story instead: used sounds to understand space and memory. This is essentially where sound studies has moved from Schafer. And it is more honest than a preservation - it recognizes that we choose our sounds to tell meaningful stories. Essentially, it follows the historiographical trajectory in academic history from the 1970s to the present day.</p>
<p>Schafer's influence is in <em>recording</em> sound in space to reproduce for others, as well as creating an archive of sounds that exist within spaces. Yet I want to posit that sound studies does not have to be about recording and reproducing sound. The audio recorder is magnificent. But that method of mechanical reproduction does not necessarily need to be the only way to experience sound. I know how counterintuitive it <em>sounds</em> that sound need not be heard to be experienced. Yet think about how much there is to sound: physically, vibrations; regarding memory, though, sound encompasses a complexity of feelings and imagination. We can talk about sound too - we can describe it to others. We can tell them the feelings we experienced hearing those sounds. The sound of a battlefield in a war film - whizzing bullets, explosions, screaming - may sound 'cool' to a child playing war, but to a veteran these sounds could elicit strong feelings of anxiety and terror. In this way we can begin to understand the entangled soundscapes of our world. By listening to others rather than experiencing the sound solely for ourselves. And when no voices exist, by imagining the possibilities of that soundscape, encompassing a myriad of other soundscapes floating in and our of existence. <strong>(This is my rationale for the oral component to this soundscape.)</strong></p>
<p>Sound visualization is another element to experiencing sound. Stuart Eve created visual sound maps of how topography effects sound location in an environment. A windy hill may block the sound of a farm on the other side of that mound. These examples share an important face that we cannot shake from Schafer: experiencing sound in space in order to reproduce it.</p>
<p>But what of my website and visualization? It is designed that the user does not input any action back to the source code. There is no echo. This is not a limitation. But we must remain aware of this. There is no two way data binding. I could have created an Angular directive to let the user effect the page. Maybe I am just playing on sonic metaphors in programming: echoes, objects speaking to each other, etc. </p>
<p>"On the basis of these considerations, all the authors of this genre present composed images, and ultimately use the sounds of the acoustic environment as the richest, most plural synthesiser possible. Even if they use complete, apparently unmanipulated sequences - remember the work for radio Wolf Music (1997), by R. Murray Schafer, in which a group of musicians spend a whole day playing his scores in a Canadian nature reserve - the manipulation lies in the way the microphones are set up and specific venues chosen. In short, it is a kind of sound mirage: an acoustic image which may aim to represent the reality in question, while actually presenting a distorted reflection which, at best, captures the aroma of the original. Only by deliberately erasing the memory of that original can we embark on a composed soundscape with any probability of success. We could go as far as to say that <strong>in these works, memory appeals to forgetfulness to endow the work itself with aesthetic meaning.</strong>" Is forgetfulness bad, though? Or is there storytelling to forgetting and remembering? Meaning is constructed through forgetting and remembering. To remember everything is not only impossible, but does not allow for the nuances of memory changing to environment, feeling, emotion, etc. No memory is ever the same. It changes each time. </p>
<p>"By the trompe-l'oeil and, more importantly here, in our concern with sound, by the trompe-l'oreille which present us with a clichéd yet inconsistent image of the world. An image which serves as a description but is not operative, as it does not provide us with the tools to construct this world of reference. It is like memory: it allows us to remember and organise personal experiences, but not to live any similar experiences or those on which it draws"</p>
<p>It's as if there is no recording, we cannot use it or it becomes an unfortunate loss. But if we have people, use people to comment on experience. If we have no people, use phenomenological approaches to space. But it comes down to space! Go there. If the space no longer exists, try your best to 'reconstruct' (though I have no idea what this means practically and theoretically/methodologically). </p>

<p>Does sound become more positive as time allows it to dissipate? It's value becomes cemented in the present. "Proust complicitously writes to Madame Williams, once these workers are gone after having become part of his routine noises, he would feel the ensuing silence as abnormal and would regret their ruckus as some sort of “lullaby” (ibid., 39)." </p>
<p>The Pembroke Factories are closed. Would those sounds, like Nana said, be ubiquitous or would they be an annoyance? I think the experience would be multifaceted, as phenomenology shows us. </p>
<p>I wrote in my GitBook that ubiquity does not necessarily entail a passive value. Sound itself is not as unimportant compared to the other senses for us. There is not enough evidence in our understanding of society to say that sound is underprivileged, at least to the extent historians have been lead to think. </p>
<p>Series calls sound a parasite... "noises are operators of irreversible time, the same lost time Proust laments, the time of nostalgia, entropy, and death." </p>
<p>"In general, noises both separate and connect Marcel’s subjectivity to what he calls “la vie extérieure.” Even a banal hissing of a pipe has a value in constructing and deconstructing memory in the text."</p>
<p>Pembroke factories viewed by FB group as sounding good. Imagine what it would be like living there... can you... with all of these noises? Can you construct and deconstruct a memory you never had? Can I?</p>

                <p><strong>Edit:</strong> But not everyone wants to be transparent. There are gender considerations such as discussed <a href="https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/152">here</a> that I just reconsidered. It doesn't deny the importance of workflow, habits, and productivity - it just causes me to think more about my own status as a white male academic online. I am a victim of my own criticisms!</p>
<p>Every historian needs a workflow. I love the approach I have taken with nvAlt, github, and using If This Then That to push my open-notebook to Twitter, as well as my online writing. I have really honed down on productivity. This is not something we should deny. Not every academic should be aloof in their own head, disorganized. Good habits make good history. Having a productive workflow that we feel comfortable sharing is important.</p>
<p>In my last post <a href="Open-Access-and-Social-Media">Open Access and Social Media</a> I made a very important claim - that (public) history is ethical only if it painstakingly cares to represent (actually or potentially) the various stakeholders, even if they have not approached the project as stakeholders. Now there is a lot of jargon here that sounds like marketing. In a sense it is. And it raises issues of who holds the power. Just because I am creating this historical project with a deliverable, does it make me the 'police' of this history? At least the organizing force? Not to toot my own horn, but in a sense yes: I am also a stakeholder and I have been educated to try to represent this history ethically and appropriately. I would never argue that I am necessary to this history, nor even the best historian for the task. But through my own theorizing, self-criticism, work flow, ethic, method, etc., I believe in my abilities to participate in this history. In fact, such an approach by historians is important: we are not the guardians of truth, telling you the facts of the past. Rather, we are trained academics who use organizational skills, research methods, ethical considerations, etc. to understand the past. And as soon as historians recognize this, they can do good work. This is where I will finally champion open access - if used ethically (that is, with a transparent method, research notes, etc.), it humanizes historians and shows method and workflow, thus putting them in their place as organizers, researchers, etc., not as academics who know the past. I want you to see how we work, how we form ideas, what we consider, etc. For most historians do this ethical work already. Yet they risk creating a false persona when everything is hidden. The Digital Humanities allows for this transparency (again, if used appropriately). Historians, then, must also be willing to fail openly. Such is why I am writing my research piece online, on top of this open notebook. </p>
<p>We must walk a fine line with open access, not being 100% transparent to the point of risking the ethical considerations of stakeholders involved, but also not closed off from our stakeholders. And thus all historians are public historians - we just all work in different realms. The most important aspect of a historian's work is the method and the workflow. That should be transparent. Information - stories - ought to be left to historians and the immediate stakeholders involved to present to other audiences. For history is storytelling about the past. Any positivist, idealistic approach that shares 100% of the information involved (the utopic idealism of open access which, I discuss in my gitbook is impossible anyways), would be rendered meaningless because we would only want and receive information. Storytelling is an art that historians must also remain aware of. In some cases historians are storytellers, in others, they help to facilitate that. We are caught up in constantly shifting roles and tasks.</p>
<p>It really is an entangled mess, isn't it?!</p>
<p><strong>I want this open-notebook approach to be accessible. Yet I am afraid that my If This Then That approach for auto-publishing to twitter furthers the illusion that this is difficult stuff only reserved for the technically savvy. These titles have dashes in them because of a 'bug' - it is just the only workaround I have for keeping the urls without spaces so IFTT will publish a working url.</strong></p>

                <p>I had my first interview today with my Nana, aunt, and mom. It was an interesting session in that they answered questions about their experiences, but they were also showing me places on Google Maps and telling me about where to research. </p>
<p>It got me thinking more about the place of public historians, at least any historian who deals with oral interviews/living subjects (let's leave managing the dead for another post), as logistic managers - organizers. I talked a bit about this in <a href="The-Ethical-Historian_A-Beautiful-Workflow">my last post</a>. My Nana mentioned that she has read many theses and academic works from different disciplines and that while interesting there is often no 'hook'. Essentially, she explained that a lot of academic work does not try to produce affect in readers. See, people understand these concepts and explore them everyday. Maybe they don't have the specific terminology used in academia, but they engage with the same ideas. <em>I realized that the people in my project and historians themselves.</em> I recognize in my GitBook that I too am a participant of different publics - ok, nothing new or groundbreaking for public history. But these interactions convince me more each day that historians help to manage histories. They bring sources together. Now historians are not menial or unimportant. We learn skills that help us create great works and tell amazing stories. But we must recognize that we all participate in the creation of truth and history regarding the past. And we should recognize our role in that creation, and to use that role the best we can. </p>

                <p>My own Facebook page has not done that well. Maybe it is an issue of how I am promoting it. I have sort of left it because the existing Pembroke Facebook group is great. Sure, it is its own specific public. But it has opened up opportunities for me. I will not abandon my page. I think once the project gets more popular it will be a better platform. And I should be careful not to just use the Pembroke Facebook page. But it has been the best approach because those people are interested in this project because of their interest in historical Pembroke (one that is personal and nostalgic). Sure, I want to brush against the grain with my method and reach out to others. And so I am doing that through networking, as well as contacting the library and the seniors centre to advertise this project. But just because a community is particular and not historically 'entirely representative' does not make it an inherently problematic public. I am building on top of these histories and publics. I am creating infinitely more entanglements through my approach - in a sense it mirrors the lack of chronology of my map (something I did not like about TimelineJS). </p>
<p>The most effective approach has been through the Pembroke Facebook group, a page with over 4000 likes. It is a vibrant online community with daily updates, sometimes several times per day. Of course this is a specific public, one that has a certain nostalgia attached to it which is reproduced by the people. It is an online hub for strangers and neighbours to talk about Pembroke, post photos from the past, etc. It is not really an advertising page. So by using this page I am approaching a certain public, creating more publics when I post (for those who comment, like, read my post). Those who do nothing with my post are a public as well. For instance, maybe people do not reach out to me because they believe this historical project is for the much older times. Thus I must be more deliberate and explicit in that I can use anyone involved. I have even used family members to get an understanding of this era for Pembroke. </p>
<p>Does widening my 'advertising' space, thus creating and reaching more publics a better approach? This gets at how we value more information from more people as a better thing. I m not saying this is wrong at all - just because I point out an 'issue' does not deny its value. This widening method allows for a more diverse approach and thus a more diverse history from a variety of publics, intersecting or entirely apart from each other. Yet it does relate to open access. It is not necessarily that the open access and the internet allows me to approach more audiences, thus making this an inherently better project. Rather, I now engage with and create new publics - ones I would have never interacted with if I chose a more traditional approach. Social media create new avenues for open access projects - but these are not necessarily inherently better. </p>
<p>I remain painstakingly aware of the crux of critical public history: that our awareness of different publics and the various stakeholders are important in avoiding a singular history. Regardless of the fact that this digital environment has accessibility issues, I must take care to make the history itself accessible. This is not an idealism attached to open access. It is a recognition that if I am to be ethical - that is, attempt to recognize the different histories involved - I have to at least try to keep them potentially approachable. My first thought here is the Aboriginal histories involved. Thus I want to also create a way for people to share their stories. I want to make this website living. In conclusion, a meaningful history necessarily cares for the various stakeholders involved. </p>
