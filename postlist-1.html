                <p>Have to use local js and css files for twine package</p>
<p>Usually, we see historians as people who go out, gather information, stories, etc., and bring it back all in to tell a story. That somehow, the product is what counts. And I am not denying the interpretive power and importance of historians. We learn valuable research and critical thinking skills for a reason. Rather, what I am trying to say is that this project - the historical stories and imagination - also exist in the Facebook group I interacted with. The people I spoke with. </p>
<p>Following Ingold, I choose sound in its relation to task. </p>
<p>I kept expecting to find stuff on Aboriginals. Nothing. They've been erased from the landscape. Pembroke does not even have its own recorded history</p>
<p>Why is this public History? What needs does it meet?
- Pembroke community interested in local history
- Ethical idea of creating publics around local history with my project
- Especially since focus is usually on logging not later industry (did not want to be another early history)
- Want to challenge the historical narrative - I focus more on workers and strikes. I also don't want to repeat things about my relative (EA Dunlop). Paul Martin accused him of being unfair to his workers. The record show this. I want to challenge the idea of industrial success showing workers hardships. I also want to leave the project open to grow more complex and to include Aboriginal voices. We can respect people without revering them; respecting them as people in their historical contexts with values we do not hold, or actions we disagree with.
- To present silences explicitly. What 'soundscapes' are missing?
- Make this project salient for my audience - this is essentially a project for the people and communities I have interacted with; the timelines for each page with historical images is based on how I interacted with the publics involved, and also how I influenced them. I posted photos and received great feedback and interest. I was shown photos by family members, I heard of people who may want to post their stories. And that is what I learned about open access digital projects. Oral interviews are still necessary, but not the end-all as I had thought. My project is saved after all since people like to tell stories other ways, sharing their memories. Obviously my project prompts a specific way of thinking and thus sharing memory. The text becomes a certain performance. But it allows for a wider audience to participate than I originally aimed for.I am not saying this is a better method. Rather I want this experience to show the issues with open access and giving people their space and time to share their stories their own way. At the very most, this project as it stands, is a catalyst for memory and thus sharing stories. I hope by attempting to build accessibility into this website, create downloadable versions, and thinking about open access, I am able to share this story to a wider audience. However, I know that there are many communities for whom this website will not reach. I have to accept that there is a certain amount of a feedback loop in the sharing of this project and the telling of stories. It is my hope though that others will find it and be driven to contribute or fork it and make it their own. Maybe, then, they can tell the stories that I have failed to find.</p>
<p>In many ways, what I did 'live' online that was most impactful was sharing in the Pembroke Facebook community. My book has comments mostly from me. Colleagues supported it, but never left feedback even if they read it. So people support the idea, but like most academic work, who really has time to read it/wants to?</p>
<p>Open access is difficult. Just because things are open does not mean they are easy to access. Because of copyright laws, I cannot reproduce everything. I can provide a bibliography, but that stuff may not be open to others. I am working from within a university, with access to databases.</p>
<p>People like to share - oral interviews can be limiting in a sense. (Importance of social media)</p>
<p>Aside from Github, I did not document my errors well. </p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I choose not follow the newspaper narrative fully. I challenge the ads that glorify companies by showing strikes. I also show the importance of local strikes more than the Daily Observer (ex. which barely talked about 1966 Eddy strike, focusing on rail.)</p>
<p>Digital soundscape: performative because I am storytelling with sound, based on the material history that is left over.</p>
<p>I aim for a bit of reparation in sentences, to drill home the closing down of industry as ubiquitous</p>
<p>I want the map to show the movement of place. A bit constrained digitally, but show how places move in a bit of chronology, highlight important places to show where resources came from, how close and important rail was for resources</p>

                <p>pembroke fb group is a serious community around which people organize their lives and memory. I am not able to take that away from them.</p>

<p>I also have to be careful not to get kicked out of the Pembroke group for advertising my page too much; need to give back to community.</p>
<p>I am finding more and more how small my publics are that I interact with.</p>
<p>open access controls narrative: use what I can find based on availability. Pembroke Observer difficult to navigate, ottawa citizen is digitized (not that observer is somehow gold standard or infallible)... -- people help but they also want to see what I've dug up.</p>
<p>It's not the best map; at this point now I could build a better one from scratch. But I learned. And I worked with someone else's code. And I learned how to build up another person's code with my own problems - to add to it</p>

<p>Synchresis: creating a soundscape for memory. </p>
<p>Not entirely accessible. I have failed here.</p>
<p>File Organization and digital preservation - machine and human readable, file types, directories made, etc. Used CDN online instead of local files.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2014/11/03/a-relaunch-for-the-pembroke-fibreboard-plant#">A relaunch for the Pembroke fibreboard plant</a> “I think tourism and forestry can get along,” he said closing with a stark warning. “If they close Algonquin Park these boards won't be here to supply all over the world.” Reminds me of being in Algonquin park and feeling entirely separate from the world immersed in quiet. When one morning over the ridge, all I hear is a chainsaw and people working. It shook me from my understanding of the land. It gave me an uneasy feeling that those sounds are ominously present. My understanding of the landscape changed immediately. I am not here passing a value judgment through that experience. Rather, I want you to understand the affect sound can have. Sounding ruins: reflections on the production of an ‘audio drift’ describes how sound can change place and bodily movements. However, we risk approaching these as 'historical tourists'. Speaking phenomenologically, I don't know how to get around this - I don't think we can. It is an entanglement in history since our own experience is mapped onto others'.</p>
<p>My map fails to produce sound in a way other than digital output, so sound is not felt, etc as it is in person. There are no rumbles, changes to body and environment the same way.You still get those changes, but I would argue they are minimal.</p>
<p>Mechanical limitation of map: some companies change locations every several years. I would have to rewrite the map source to change that</p>
<p>Affect is in the sound. The text is rather 'factual'. A web page is silent. We don't immediately place sound on images or text (sound is placed differently by the imagination on a computer than real life?). Sound produces affect. I am gathering and employing sound clips honestly. What happens when you turn your sound off? What do you hear in the silences? This project is more a sonification of the past than recreating soundscapes because </p>
<p>I don't have to be <em>the</em> authority. I can say the trail ends here and petition others to help. </p>
<p>Having to rely on school's newspaper database, newspaper free trial, and searching microfilm is not exactly the open access we dream of. Open access should be about easy access to information. Using the observer online is not the best either because I cannot see each article in context. The graphical artefact has its meaning changed on a computer screen, being called by a server, presented in a new context with new styles, etc. Now, too I do not see ads or what others may see because of how my browser is set up. It is not just the information we are grabbing from these papers, but the context.</p>
<p>Maybe an Aboriginal Soundscape would not even focus on industry. Maybe that would not be as high priority as I have given it. The industrial history is not even as high a priority for many. However large that Facebook group is, only a small minority of the people interact with the group, and they are even a specific public within that community. The Facebook page has become about them. </p>
<p>I have realized that this soundscapes project reflect the theory of sound studies - sound is not isolated nor alone. It is entangled in perception. That is why I use it - though carefully - not in recreating a 'soundscape' but to trigger memory. My project focuses on memory and sound rather than acoustics of space and sound (explain sound bash) because I focus explicitly on producing affect related to memory. Not that acoustics and space cannot produce affect, but it is geared for a different experience of space over memory. To produce the same affect, I would have to create a sound walk in accessible places, triggered by geolocation. </p>
<p>Strikes not front page news in Pembroke newspapers. Newspapers are not the best sources, but in the records I have, they are some of the best. I piece together this history with photos, newspapers, government documents, maps; I begin to locate sound in space; yet this is all an act of historical imagination. I didn't find the neat history I was looking for of newspapers mentioning "the sounds of strikers were heard around the town today". It's not bad for historians to have assumptions - that is how we find patterns in our sources. However, historians cannot rely on assumptions. Assumptions can help us begin our work, but we cannot fit our history into those initial assumptions. </p>
<p>This project is not an attempt to recreate 'the' industrial soundscape of Pembroke. That is why I can apply ideas like synchresis. Rather, this project performs the past through sound to elicit memory and thus create community engagement. The framework was built to serve a community purpose: the code is all open; files, photographs, and sounds are all available to be viewed. I don't expect to 'get the sounds right'. I want, rather, to use this as a tool to begin exploring Pembroke's history. Thus it remains a very particularly crafted project. </p>
<p>In part, the representation of an industrial soundscape is a product of necessity and accessibility. I believe in the new sound studies practice of using sound within space to understand the environment rather than attempting to reconstruct a 'soundscape', as if hearing is a distinct reality attained solely through perceiving noise through one's ears. But these spaces are unavailable. And the factories that remain are inaccessible to me. I could still attempt a sound study of space, akin to a sound bash. For the spaces without factories nevertheless have distinct markings of task and are understood as places of dwelling (See Ingold: taskscape). But I want to study the relationship between sound and memory with my Pembroke stakeholders in mind. I do not want an abstract sound project, but a deliverable accessible to and with input from my stakeholders (much of that input being implicit in the Facebook group, talking to people, understanding my audience) that 'forefronts' sound to understand how listening impacts memory, and retains the potential to grow and change as people interact with the website. Ultimately, and with great aspiration, this project could be a practical pedagogical tool.</p>

                <p>Why Use the interface at all?</p>
<p>Not only do you learn more about your machine, but you begin to master an integral way to access files. You'll have noticed that with the cat command, you see the beginning of regex. In the next lesson, Milligan and Baker go over this more and show what commands like grep and wc can do. We are building towards more powerful regex</p>
<p>Harkens back to low processing power: if you use an old machine, it can take over most of the commands.</p>
<p>"The primary reason is the seamless experience of working on the command line: you never have to pick up your mouse or touch your track pad, and, although it has a steep learning curve it can eventually become a sole writing environment."</p>
<p>You should set your machine to work for you.</p>
<p>Vim is a fork of Vi, an editor for the Unix command line.</p>
<p>How can you see editing in the command line integral to regex? (fixing lines).</p>
<p>You should also read this: http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/preserving-your-research-data suggested by the mining research data article. Mining data, searching, etc. will help you immensely. Meta-data is so important</p>
<hr />
<p>Regular expression tutorial makes an important point. This is not about becoming a programmer. Programming takes years to master and you might find it interesting but don't exactly want to get into it. There is a lot of stuff going on in life. That's what these tutorial do - help you modify your workflow and use modern tools and methods to increase productivity. </p>
<p>I prefer text wrangler. You have to know your text at some level to know what to change. Larger files will be more difficult to clean up, more consistent files will be easier, bad OCR will lead to poor results if not cleaned.</p>

                <p>Open Access: how to make information consumable and geared towards stakeholders, answering their needs, vs. presenting information in a way I would like to.</p>
<p>There is a huge digital negotiation anticipating platforms in a public history project. It is public history because it is built taking into account the stakeholders. The line is grey between 'public history' and 'regular history' because of the potential each digital project has to be viewed by the public. But here, a public history digital project is one that accounts, expects, and <em>must</em> be built for a wider community usage rather than just a project that works on your machine. In other words, it means taking into account a range of accessibility issues rather than building solely around your platform. </p>
<p>Yet at some point, you cannot fully sacrifice a project to satisfy outdated or poorly browsers. There is some functionality in my website that may slow with poor bandwidth or poor functioning browsers like Internet Explorer of Opera. On the other hand - with a project involving open access and reproducibility - I cannot create a completely experimental design that is only supported by ultra-modern browsers with full support, run on a machine with high working memory, and a network with consistent speeds. I tried to account for these issues by configuring the website for all major browser standards, as well as offering this project to be downloaded as a desktop app. That way, aside from the initial download, I remove network issues running this project online. In a typical website, a server hosts all files which are called by the user only when needed. For instance, your computer does not preload all the pages of a website. Rather, when you click a link to go to the next page of the website, it sends a request to the server for that page. Now, this is not the absolute case - not only do scripting and stylistic elements preload on a web page, but newer, single page web applications preloads the pages of a website which increases a websites speed and efficiency (ex. see this SPA I created using AngularJS captialhistory.ca).</p>
<p>Throughout building this project, I struggled with the core principle that underlies my actions and creative powers: open access. The goal was to use digital projects as a kind of historiography of open access (where git commits, code commenting, etc. acts as a historiographical record). I would take the source code of a current digital project on Github, fork and modify the code to fit my needs. I started with DAEA but found Jack Dougherty's storymap more tailored to my needs (which in turn was forked on a Github project based on a different Mapbox project). Yet every project has its limitations. I had less control than I needed over my project with the storymap source code because it is currently controlled through javascript. I could have completely overhauled the project, designing it so that the map is primarily controlled through HTML elements with GeoJSON rather than javascript controlling HTML interpreted through GeoJSON (as in the original Mapbox code https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/scroll-driven-navigation/). There were other options to present an interactive story-driven map (http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/12/16/animated-map-path-for-interactive-storytelling/). But with the principle of open access, the leaflet javascript library that serves as the engine for my scroll driven map is entirely open source - meaning anyone can build upon it, making it there own - has full documentation, is used widely across many disciplines, and, therefore, has a great support community that consistently designs and produces new features. </p>
<p>Finally, I am bound by the practical time limitations of this project. I also had to do the actual historical fieldwork and archival research; write the front end website text for the users; manage file names and directories, comment on and explain code (ie. future proofing my work); procure and organize photos and sounds; scan and georectify the historical maps; and finally write a reflection on my work. All of these variables meant that I ended up with the project currently online, even if it is not the final product I necessarily wanted. Therefore, in my experience on this and other digital projects, I offer this definition of public history work: <strong>the practice of producing a collaborative project that anticipates the explicit and implicit negotiated needs of constantly shifting known and unknown stakeholders, within a seemingly infinite and simultaneous dance of recursive and discursive 'limitations' that you recognize as forever incomplete.</strong> Public History work is about as easy to navigate as that definition. Put simply public historians are marketers acting with post structuralist ideas of history. And we must be honest about the stakeholders that 'drive' our work and build in the potential to expand that work. I did this by letting people tell their own stories, brushing both against and along the historical narrative, and making my work entirely open and reproducible. By showing the history of strikes and recognizing that there is a history before settlers in Pembroke, that sounds are not entirely the same to everyone, I hope to cause a positive level of discomfort. But, of course, this is a subtle art. </p>
<p>But there is one final issue that arose on this last point: people expect historians to tell them facts and stories about the past. Maybe this project will be viewed with an academic backdrop and thus not receive the same input or level of discussion as when I post archival photos to Pembroke. I hope I made this map accessible enough (with the map, historical maps, timeline, and sounds).</p>
