<p>Why I interview people - to understand their salience landscape so that I am not creating something misguided - what level of moral accountability do I hold them to</p>
<p>But not total relativism because, at least in an abstract understanding, being truthful is important to understanding your own salience landscape, regardless of where you are from and who you are -- is radical relativism borne from a, dare I say, laziness about language - that language is the end all and complete representative of thought so that words I use with different understandings behind them are somehow only true to me? There is something that connects us all as humans, and it is these ideas - for instance, truth to yourself to figure out what your problem is - that are not relative</p>

                <p>A thought process regarding open access and publics: </p>
<ol>
<li>My project is purportedly <em>open access</em></li>
<li>I assume that more access is a better thing</li>
<li>After examination, it seems that the <em>open access</em> aspect of this project is much more limited than the 'utopic' abstract notion of that phrase purports.  </li>
<li><em>Open access</em> means information can reach a wider <em>public</em></li>
<li>But <em>the public</em> is in fact a myriad of small publics I create through this project, mostly white, male academics.</li>
<li>Therefore, because this public is so much smaller and the ideal of open access is that a wider public is a good thing, my public(s) is(are) limited</li>
<li>My Public History is limited and therefore, not as good as if it reached more people</li>

                <p>Phenomenology is the best approach in my view because it looks at sound through experience.  This is limited of course because it is <em>only</em> human experience. It is also a view of the world created by western philosophy, not used by the best people (i.e. Heidegger was a Nazi).</p>
<p>Phenomenology, though, captures the essence of empathy: that all we can do is listen, but not get caught up in ourselves. To listen to others, to see that there is always an audience, however 'small' or 'limited' it may be. And do understand that they may not hear the same as you, but nevertheless they listen too. </p>

                <p>Ian Hodder writes in <em>Entangled</em> about ubiquity (pp. 102-103)</p>
<p><em>we tend to forget the history of things because: we do not need to know how something works until it breaks down
</em>we work without knowing the histories of things; our habitual routinization with things; working of things are often hidden; the strings of entanglement are often so long and complex and chaotic that we cannot monitor them; because of different temporalities; entanglements transform based on their use; things become distanced on place and time â€” this can all be said for sound; we become so accustomed to it</p>
