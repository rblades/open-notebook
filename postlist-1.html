There were a lot of features I wanted to add that I did not move forward with because they would be fluff - cool, but ultimately inauthentic for this historical digital landscape.</p>
<p>Structuring the code for future operability, deprecation, cross-platform usage, quick load times; less memory-heavy tasks (people could be using older computers, older browsers). I'm operating under the assumption that people are using updated browsers (now, major browsers will support html5.</p>
<p>Deprecation of digital projects: hosted on github. Uses hosted api libraries where I could.</p>

                <p>Hodder (96) says that entanglement accounts for the chronology of things and the debts, obligations, etc. they pick up along the way: so my sounds I record at the woodshop will involve this notion</p>
<p>I have to accept the moral implication that this history thus gets my own positive experience of the sounds of the woodshop entangled with it. This is a historiographical mantra I must show you.</p>
<p>My readings of Hodder and Ingold were initially meant to explore sound historically phenomenologically in Pembroke, reflecting on the long duree. Yet through my research process, as more becomes apparent to me, I realize it has more an important implication for my reflexivity as a historian.</p>
<p>And Hodder implies that it is not (should not) be our task to untangle the past. We would be better off trying to iron down the mess than untangle it one string at a time. He argues (222) that entanglement â€œis about being caught up in real things in specific ways that come about through complex interactions. It is not bounded, schematic, theoretical. It describes the ways in which we live our lives struggling between webs of demand and potential, making do, working it out, unclear what is happening much of the time, not knowing the results of our actions and why. We can never mop up all this mess."</p>

<p>their sonification is not yours</p>
<p>Why I interview people - to understand their salience landscape so that I am not creating something misguided - what level of moral accountability do I hold them to</p>
<p>But not total relativism because, at least in an abstract understanding, being truthful is important to understanding your own salience landscape, regardless of where you are from and who you are -- is radical relativism borne from a, dare I say, laziness about language - that language is the end all and complete representative of thought so that words I use with different understandings behind them are somehow only true to me? There is something that connects us all as humans, and it is these ideas - for instance, truth to yourself to figure out what your problem is - that are not relative</p>
