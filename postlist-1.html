                <p>Phenomenology is the best approach in my view because it looks at sound through experience.  This is limited of course because it is <em>only</em> human experience. It is also a view of the world created by western philosophy, not used by the best people (i.e. Heidegger was a Nazi).</p>
<p>Phenomenology, though, captures the essence of empathy: that all we can do is listen, but not get caught up in ourselves. To listen to others, to see that there is always an audience, however 'small' or 'limited' it may be. And do understand that they may not hear the same as you, but nevertheless they listen too. </p>

                <p>Ian Hodder writes in <em>Entangled</em> about ubiquity (pp. 102-103)</p>
<p><em>we tend to forget the history of things because: we do not need to know how something works until it breaks down
</em>we work without knowing the histories of things; our habitual routinization with things; working of things are often hidden; the strings of entanglement are often so long and complex and chaotic that we cannot monitor them; because of different temporalities; entanglements transform based on their use; things become distanced on place and time — this can all be said for sound; we become so accustomed to it</p>

                <p>The philosopher Don Ihde wrote in <em>Listening and Voice</em> (1976) that 
<em>119: There is an imaginative mode to hearing
</em>122: remembering sound is an imaginative act that implies inner experience - imaginative acts implicate the self </p>
<p>Similarly Mark Grimshaw and Tom Garner write in <em>Sonic Virtuality</em> (2014) that sound waves do not produce sound; rather, sound is imagined and we offload it into our environments</p>

                <p>What I heard had good value. Loud or even distressing noises were good to my ears because it meant success. To others, it may hurt their ears, annoy them, stress them, bring about bad memories.  </p>
<p>How to make subjectivity of sounds problematic by implicit in map? First, read my audience: shoe that these are recreated sounds. That will get them thinking about sound historically and not as these as timeless sounds. I feel actual workers will be more critical, least I can only hope. It's the other publics I have to worry about.</p>
