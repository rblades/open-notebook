<p>Have to use local js and css files for twine package</p>
<p>Usually, we see historians as people who go out, gather information, stories, etc., and bring it back all in to tell a story. That somehow, the product is what counts. And I am not denying the interpretive power and importance of historians. We learn valuable research and critical thinking skills for a reason. Rather, what I am trying to say is that this project - the historical stories and imagination - also exist in the Facebook group I interacted with. The people I spoke with. </p>
<p>Following Ingold, I choose sound in its relation to task. </p>
<p>I kept expecting to find stuff on Aboriginals. Nothing. They've been erased from the landscape. Pembroke does not even have its own recorded history</p>
<p>Why is this public History? What needs does it meet?
- Pembroke community interested in local history
- Ethical idea of creating publics around local history with my project
- Especially since focus is usually on logging not later industry (did not want to be another early history)
- Want to challenge the historical narrative - I focus more on workers and strikes. I also don't want to repeat things about my relative (EA Dunlop). Paul Martin accused him of being unfair to his workers. The record show this. I want to challenge the idea of industrial success showing workers hardships. I also want to leave the project open to grow more complex and to include Aboriginal voices. We can respect people without revering them; respecting them as people in their historical contexts with values we do not hold, or actions we disagree with.
- To present silences explicitly. What 'soundscapes' are missing?
- Make this project salient for my audience - this is essentially a project for the people and communities I have interacted with; the timelines for each page with historical images is based on how I interacted with the publics involved, and also how I influenced them. I posted photos and received great feedback and interest. I was shown photos by family members, I heard of people who may want to post their stories. And that is what I learned about open access digital projects. Oral interviews are still necessary, but not the end-all as I had thought. My project is saved after all since people like to tell stories other ways, sharing their memories. Obviously my project prompts a specific way of thinking and thus sharing memory. The text becomes a certain performance. But it allows for a wider audience to participate than I originally aimed for.I am not saying this is a better method. Rather I want this experience to show the issues with open access and giving people their space and time to share their stories their own way. At the very most, this project as it stands, is a catalyst for memory and thus sharing stories. I hope by attempting to build accessibility into this website, create downloadable versions, and thinking about open access, I am able to share this story to a wider audience. However, I know that there are many communities for whom this website will not reach. I have to accept that there is a certain amount of a feedback loop in the sharing of this project and the telling of stories. It is my hope though that others will find it and be driven to contribute or fork it and make it their own. Maybe, then, they can tell the stories that I have failed to find.</p>
<p>In many ways, what I did 'live' online that was most impactful was sharing in the Pembroke Facebook community. My book has comments mostly from me. Colleagues supported it, but never left feedback even if they read it. So people support the idea, but like most academic work, who really has time to read it/wants to?</p>
<p>Open access is difficult. Just because things are open does not mean they are easy to access. Because of copyright laws, I cannot reproduce everything. I can provide a bibliography, but that stuff may not be open to others. I am working from within a university, with access to databases.</p>
<p>People like to share - oral interviews can be limiting in a sense. (Importance of social media)</p>
<p>Aside from Github, I did not document my errors well. </p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I choose not follow the newspaper narrative fully. I challenge the ads that glorify companies by showing strikes. I also show the importance of local strikes more than the Daily Observer (ex. which barely talked about 1966 Eddy strike, focusing on rail.)</p>
<p>Digital soundscape: performative because I am storytelling with sound, based on the material history that is left over.</p>
<p>I aim for a bit of repetition in sentences, to drill home the closing down of industry as ubiquitous</p>
<p>I want the map to show the movement of place. A bit constrained digitally, but show how places move in a bit of chronology, highlight important places to show where resources came from, how close and important rail was for resources</p>
