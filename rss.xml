        <description>A thought process regarding open access and publics: 1. My project is purportedly *open access* 2. I assume that more access is a better thing 3.

        <description>The philosopher Don Ihde wrote in *Listening and Voice* (1976) that *119: There is an imaginative mode to hearing *122: remembering sound is an imaginative act that implies inner experience - imaginative acts implicate the self Similarly Mark Grimshaw and Tom Garner write in *Sonic Virtuality* (2014) that sound waves...</description>
