        <description>The problem with accuracy is the value we attached to the sensory experience. Affect is not historically mimicked when accuracy is attained. A sound for me is positive... not for them necessarily....</description>

        <description>A thought process regarding open access and publics: 1. My project is purportedly *open access* 2. I assume that more access is a better thing 3.

        <description>Phenomenology is the best approach in my view because it looks at sound through experience. This is limited of course because it is *only* human experience. It is also a view of the world created by western philosophy, not used by the best people (i.e. Heidegger was a Nazi). Phenomenology,...</description>

        <description>Ian Hodder writes in *Entangled* about ubiquity (pp. 102-103) *we tend to forget the history of things because: we do not need to know how something works until it breaks down *we work without knowing the histories of things; our habitual routinization with things; working of things are often hidden;...</description>

        <description>The philosopher Don Ihde wrote in *Listening and Voice* (1976) that *119: There is an imaginative mode to hearing *122: remembering sound is an imaginative act that implies inner experience - imaginative acts implicate the self Similarly Mark Grimshaw and Tom Garner write in *Sonic Virtuality* (2014) that sound waves...</description>
