        <description>I had my first interview today with my Nana, aunt, and mom. It was an interesting session in that they answered questions about their experiences, but they were also showing me places on Google Maps and telling me about where to research. It got me thinking more about the place...</description>

        <description>**Edit:** But not everyone wants to be transparent. There are gender considerations such as discussed [here](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/152) that I just reconsidered. It doesn't deny the importance of workflow, habits, and productivity - it just causes me to think more about my own status as a white male academic online. I am...</description>

        <description>My own Facebook page has not done that well. Maybe it is an issue of how I am promoting it. I have sort of left it because the existing Pembroke Facebook group is great. Sure, it is its own specific public. But it has opened up opportunities for me. I...</description>

        <description>Combatting feature creep - want the digital to be a part of the history, not just add cool features for the hell of it, but add then for userbility, clean interface, etc. Angular does just this - avoid linear and hyperlinking.

        <title>The Moral Implications of Entanglement</title>

        <pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 23:25:20 EST</pubDate>
        <description>Hodder (96) says that entanglement accounts for the chronology of things and the debts, obligations, etc. they pick up along the way: so my sounds I record at the woodshop will involve this notion I have to accept the moral implication that this history thus gets my own positive experience...</description>

        <description>The problem with accuracy is the value we attached to the sensory experience. Affect is not historically mimicked when accuracy is attained. A sound for me is positive... not for them necessarily....</description>

        <description>salience landscape their sonification is not yours Why I interview people - to understand their salience landscape so that I am not creating something misguided - what level of moral accountability do I hold them to But not total relativism because, at least in an abstract understanding, being truthful is...</description>

        <description>A thought process regarding open access and publics: 1. My project is purportedly *open access* 2. I assume that more access is a better thing 3. After examination, it seems that the *open access* aspect of this project is much more limited than the 'utopic' abstract notion of that phrase...</description>

        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:03:05 EST</pubDate>
        <description>Phenomenology is the best approach in my view because it looks at sound through experience. This is limited of course because it is *only* human experience. It is also a view of the world created by western philosophy, not used by the best people (i.e. Heidegger was a Nazi). Phenomenology,...</description>

        <description>Ian Hodder writes in *Entangled* about ubiquity (pp. 102-103) *we tend to forget the history of things because: we do not need to know how something works until it breaks down *we work without knowing the histories of things; our habitual routinization with things; working of things are often hidden;...</description>

        <description>The philosopher Don Ihde wrote in *Listening and Voice* (1976) that *119: There is an imaginative mode to hearing *122: remembering sound is an imaginative act that implies inner experience - imaginative acts implicate the self Similarly Mark Grimshaw and Tom Garner write in *Sonic Virtuality* (2014) that sound waves...</description>

        <description>What I heard had good value. Loud or even distressing noises were good to my ears because it meant success. To others, it may hurt their ears, annoy them, stress them, bring about bad memories. How to make subjectivity of sounds problematic by implicit in map? First, read my audience:...</description>
