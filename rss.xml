        <description>Have to use local js and css files for twine package Usually, we see historians as people who go out, gather information, stories, etc., and bring it back all in to tell a story. That somehow, the product is what counts. And I am not denying the interpretive power and...</description>

        <description>pembroke fb group is a serious community around which people organize their lives and memory. I am not able to take that away from them. what is my relation to memory? Obviously immediately nana; she is like baba, helping me so much by her own volition - but what else?...</description>

        <description> Wget There are other methods to download stuff on the internet. What makes wget good? Wow... you can do so much with such a tiny little command. The best aspect is `-r` or recursive retrieval which follows links from a website (to a certain depth). Mine all the things!...</description>

        <description>I wracked my brain for a whole day but I did it! I added audio to Jack Dougherty's [leaflet storymap](https://github.com/JackDougherty/leaflet-storymap). To do this: 1. Open your terminal and `cd` to the `leaflet-storymap` directory 2. Make a new folder for audio files `mkdir audio` 3. Add your audio files to this...</description>

        <description> Happy to Start HIST5702! I love GitHub! It is easy to push content to it. I also love the fact that I can run a free website from your account. I currently run [my own site](http://bladesrob.com) with [Reclaim Hosting](http://reclaimhosting.com/). However, I also run my grad work at [rblades.github.io](http://rblades.github.io) (with...</description>

        <description>Design has sound; rougher designs will have harsher sounds than warm ones. I aim to mix things up Multimedia helps to create a complex perceptual environment rather than just one focused on sounds (Ingold critiques the divide of the senses that soundscapes promote, even unintentionally)....</description>

        <description>We are not just distant reading sources - we are distant reading the historicity of these digital tools and the practices and methods entangled in them through years of habit and process. We are taking our critiques into the digital realm to offer Sarah Durrant to historical care and attention...</description>

        <description>The digital is an augmented reality in Stuart Eve's terms - that is, a user works in the "real world while visually receiving additional computer generated or modelled information." But even non-digital historical work is an augmented reality in itself since we approach the past by layering sources and drawing...</description>

        <description>The current collection of digital material that forms the basis for most of our research is composed of the maudlin leavings of rich dead white men (and some rich dead white women). Until we get around to including the non-cannonical, the non-Western, the non-textual and the non-elite, we are unlikely...</description>

        <description>There is an element of augmented reality in the layers of these digital sources. A source code is emulated as an interface. It is easy, then, to get caught up in the habit of clicking and getting. Digital humanists must learn the dirty art of doing the work themselves, least...</description>

        <description>Everything has a history. As Hitchcock notes, DH historicity = ideas of codebreaking and 'cracking' from the 20th century. We fall into those same tropes and traps. In my own work on sound studies, this is particularly true of my map: listening has a history formed by years of recorded...</description>

        <description>Confronted by people happy to define a point on the earth's surface as three simple numbers, and to claim that it was always so, was a shock. This is not to say that the archaeologists were being na√Øve, far from it, but that having been trained up as a text...</description>

        <description>It feels to me as if our practise as humanists and historians is being driven by the technology, rather than being served by it. We are being driven by it only if we refuse to understand its structure and purpose and then critique it and our understanding of it. Hitchcock...</description>

        <description>There was an industrial revolution involving iron. There was a war in the 1860s and so on. What surprises me most, is that I am not more surprised. In part, I suspect the banal character of most ngrams and network analyses is a reflection of the extent to which books,...</description>

        <description>...big data is using one of the controlling metaphors of 20th-century science, 'code breaking' and applying it to a field that has hitherto resisted the siren call of analytical positivism. Open access for historians can fall into this same issue since they assume it is a matter of sharing everything;...</description>

        <description>And for all the fact that we have mapped and photographed her, Sarah remains most fully represented in the text of her trial. We can so easily reproduce the archives. We get caught up in the fact that we are doing something new. Don't let the digital smokescreen get you!...</description>
