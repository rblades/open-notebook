        <description> Zotero Zotero is an amazing tool to save and share resources. It also has helped me from 2010 to gather and export my resources to a bibliography.

        <description> Wget There are other methods to download stuff on the internet. What makes wget good? Wow... you can do so much with such a tiny little command. The best aspect is `-r` or recursive retrieval which follows links from a website (to a certain depth). Mine all the things!...</description>

        <description>Be careful where you install software. I recently helped a colleague experiencing python problems: We attempted to install the internet archive for python to no avail on a mac.

        <description> Markdown Markdown is a sustainable method to write. Your text becomes simply text read by the computer rather than text with stylesheets and all sorts of encoding attached to it. Thus anyone can copy and paste it, read it, etc. all from the source.

        <description>In a meeting with my supervisor Shawn Graham, he critiqued our practice in the humanities that focuses on pre-applying theory to the content of our studies. He argued that theory comes out of practice and method. This became clear to me when I listened critically to what I was saying...</description>
