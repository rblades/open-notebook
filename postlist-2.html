                <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>Markdown is a sustainable method to write. Your text becomes simply text read by the computer rather than text with stylesheets and all sorts of encoding attached to it. Thus anyone can copy and paste it, read it, etc. all from the source. Markdown, then, is in many ways a way to write collaborative documents to be used by current and potential users. At the base, you should make your work available in plain text, especially if you know it will be used quite a bit. Markdown is also very easy to master. Someone in class said they only write in HTML. But this markup text with such unnecessary elements that makes working with your source very difficult. Markdown is also a streamlined and productive way to write. This is why Markdown has replaced methods like HTML as an industry standard.</p>
<h2 id="pandoc">Pandoc</h2>
<p>But what do you actually do when you need to apply certain stylesheets to markdown, convert it, etc. Pandora is a command line tool that can do all sorts of things for markdown. You can convert to different formats like word or pdf. But you can also streamline more of your writing process. I swear, markdown should be a standard in the humanities. The thought of microsoft word makes me queasy. Used in conjunction with Zotero, which we <a href="Zotero-Sparql">discuss in the coming weeks</a>, humanities scholars can collect resources and manage their references with Zotero, download the bibliography file associated with those references, and use Pandoc to convert them to markdown. Pandora will also change the citation style, from Chicago to inline, etc. </p>

<p>The command line was used to access a computer before the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Harkens back to low processing power and lack of a GUI. if you use an old machine, it can take over most of the commands.</p>
<p>So why use the command line at all anymore?</p>
<p>Not only do you learn more about your machine, but you begin to master an integral way to access files. You'll have noticed that with the cat command, you see the beginning of regex. In the next lesson, Milligan and Baker go over this more and show what commands like grep and wc can do. We are building towards more powerful regex</p>
<p>"The primary reason is the seamless experience of working on the command line: you never have to pick up your mouse or touch your track pad, and, although it has a steep learning curve it can eventually become a sole writing environment."</p>
<p>Vim is a fork of Vi, an editor for the Unix command line. But vim is difficult to understand. Using the command line is a personal choice. But you should set your machine to work for you. The point of these tutorials is that you can tap the potential of the command line and even use it to do anything on the computer.</p>
<p>You should also read this: http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/preserving-your-research-data suggested by the mining research data article. Mining data, searching, etc. will help you immensely. Meta-data is so important</p>
<h2 id="regex">Regex</h2>
<p>Regular expression tutorial makes an important point. This is not about becoming a programmer. Programming takes years to master and you might find it interesting but don't exactly want to get into it. There is a lot of stuff going on in life. That's what these tutorial do - help you modify your workflow and use modern tools and methods to increase productivity. </p>
<p>You have to know your text at some level to know what to change. Larger files will be more difficult to clean up, more consistent files will be easier, bad OCR will lead to poor results if not cleaned.</p>
<p>In the end, your platform effects what you can do and what you type: I prefer text wrangler to handle regex. Having data in XML is so helpful because you have a structured file to apply practically anywhere.</p>

                <p>In a meeting with my supervisor Shawn Graham, he critiqued our practice in the humanities that focuses on pre-applying theory to the content of our studies. He argued that theory comes out of practice and method. This became clear to me when I listened critically to what I was saying and writing. Historians are critical, but we tend to fall into reproducing 'subconscious' scripts learned in the academy. Mine was that sound is <em>(re)presented</em> in <em>space</em> and that humans <em>embody</em> sound. There is a lot of truth to this idea. Yet look at how vague that statement is, regardless of how I rearrange the sentences/substitute words. Imagine if I just went out into the field, abstractedly connecting these buzzwords to my practice and then uncritically writing about them later. We throw around buzzwords and have trouble challenging their meaning. This is why we must critique theory while engaging with it. I use my phenomenological approach to critique understandings of space and sound. For however I looked at it, I could always feel distance in my project - my map felt distant; I felt historical distance from my subjects. <em>This is why I liked Hodder's description of entanglement. The visual prompt does not imbue ideas of seamlessness. It shows how ideas, emotions, truths, falsities, and experiences are grabbed into the entangled sphere of reality, slithering around. There are spaces in this reality, in between the strings of experience. There is both distance and closeness. Experience is complex.</em> But my inner 'script' told me abstractedly there is no distance.</p>
<p>I had an abstract understanding of sound as embodied, space as immersive. Helmreich argues that transduction does not fit everything. I believe the study of space fits my project. I just need to be less automatic in my use of these buzzwords and explain what exactly I mean by them. I am more explaining my own phenomenology of sound while experiencing Pembroke's 'soundscapes' than describing historical perspectives of the sonified industrial landscape.</p>

                <p>Open Access: how to make information consumable and geared towards stakeholders, answering their needs, vs. presenting information in a way I would like to.</p>
<p>There is a huge digital negotiation anticipating platforms in a public history project. It is public history because it is built taking into account the stakeholders. The line is grey between 'public history' and 'regular history' because of the potential each digital project has to be viewed by the public. But here, a public history digital project is one that accounts, expects, and <em>must</em> be built for a wider community usage rather than just a project that works on your machine. In other words, it means taking into account a range of accessibility issues rather than building solely around your platform. </p>
<p>Yet at some point, you cannot fully sacrifice a project to satisfy outdated or poorly browsers. There is some functionality in my website that may slow with poor bandwidth or poor functioning browsers like Internet Explorer of Opera. On the other hand - with a project involving open access and reproducibility - I cannot create a completely experimental design that is only supported by ultra-modern browsers with full support, run on a machine with high working memory, and a network with consistent speeds. I tried to account for these issues by configuring the website for all major browser standards, as well as offering this project to be downloaded as a desktop app. That way, aside from the initial download, I remove network issues running this project online. In a typical website, a server hosts all files which are called by the user only when needed. For instance, your computer does not preload all the pages of a website. Rather, when you click a link to go to the next page of the website, it sends a request to the server for that page. Now, this is not the absolute case - not only do scripting and stylistic elements preload on a web page, but newer, single page web applications preloads the pages of a website which increases a websites speed and efficiency (ex. see this SPA I created using AngularJS captialhistory.ca).</p>
<p>Throughout building this project, I struggled with the core principle that underlies my actions and creative powers: open access. The goal was to use digital projects as a kind of historiography of open access (where git commits, code commenting, etc. acts as a historiographical record). I would take the source code of a current digital project on Github, fork and modify the code to fit my needs. I started with DAEA but found Jack Dougherty's storymap more tailored to my needs (which in turn was forked on a Github project based on a different Mapbox project). Yet every project has its limitations. I had less control than I needed over my project with the storymap source code because it is currently controlled through javascript. I could have completely overhauled the project, designing it so that the map is primarily controlled through HTML elements with GeoJSON rather than javascript controlling HTML interpreted through GeoJSON (as in the original Mapbox code https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/scroll-driven-navigation/). There were other options to present an interactive story-driven map (http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/12/16/animated-map-path-for-interactive-storytelling/). But with the principle of open access, the leaflet javascript library that serves as the engine for my scroll driven map is entirely open source - meaning anyone can build upon it, making it there own - has full documentation, is used widely across many disciplines, and, therefore, has a great support community that consistently designs and produces new features. </p>
<p>Finally, I am bound by the practical time limitations of this project. I also had to do the actual historical fieldwork and archival research; write the front end website text for the users; manage file names and directories, comment on and explain code (ie. future proofing my work); procure and organize photos and sounds; scan and georectify the historical maps; and finally write a reflection on my work. All of these variables meant that I ended up with the project currently online, even if it is not the final product I necessarily wanted. Therefore, in my experience on this and other digital projects, I offer this definition of public history work: **the practice of producing a collaborative project that anticipates the explicit and implicit negotiated needs of constantly shifting known and unknown stakeholders, within a seemingly infinite and simultaneous dance of recursive and discursive 'limitations' that you recognize as forever incomplete. Public History work is about as easy to navigate as that definition. Put simply public historians are marketers acting with post structuralist ideas of history. And wche must be honest about the stakeholders that 'drive' our work and build in the potential to expand that work. I did this by letting people tell their own stories, brushing both against and along the historical narrative, and making my work entirely open and reproducible. By showing the history of strikes and recognizing that there is a history before settlers in Pembroke, that sounds are not entirely the same to everyone, I hope to cause a positive level of discomfort. But, of course, this is a subtle art. </p>
<p>But there is one final issue that arose on this last point: people expect historians to tell them facts and stories about the past. Maybe this project will be viewed with an academic backdrop and thus not receive the same input or level of discussion as when I post archival photos to Pembroke. I hope I made this map accessible enough (with the map, historical maps, timeline, and sounds).</p>

<p>Usually, we see historians as people who go out, gather information, stories, etc., and bring it back all in to tell a story. That somehow, the product is what counts. And I am not denying the interpretive power and importance of historians. We learn valuable research and critical thinking skills for a reason. Rather, what I am trying to say is that this project - the historical stories and imagination - also exist in the Facebook group I interacted with. The people I spoke with. </p>
<p>Following Ingold, I choose sound in its relation to task. </p>
<p>I kept expecting to find stuff on Aboriginals. Nothing. They've been erased from the landscape. Pembroke does not even have its own recorded history</p>
<p>Why is this public History? What needs does it meet?
- Pembroke community interested in local history
- Ethical idea of creating publics around local history with my project
- Especially since focus is usually on logging not later industry (did not want to be another early history)
- Want to challenge the historical narrative - I focus more on workers and strikes. I also don't want to repeat things about my relative (EA Dunlop). Paul Martin accused him of being unfair to his workers. The record show this. I want to challenge the idea of industrial success showing workers hardships. I also want to leave the project open to grow more complex and to include Aboriginal voices. We can respect people without revering them; respecting them as people in their historical contexts with values we do not hold, or actions we disagree with.
- To present silences explicitly. What 'soundscapes' are missing?
- Make this project salient for my audience - this is essentially a project for the people and communities I have interacted with; the timelines for each page with historical images is based on how I interacted with the publics involved, and also how I influenced them. I posted photos and received great feedback and interest. I was shown photos by family members, I heard of people who may want to post their stories. And that is what I learned about open access digital projects. Oral interviews are still necessary, but not the end-all as I had thought. My project is saved after all since people like to tell stories other ways, sharing their memories. Obviously my project prompts a specific way of thinking and thus sharing memory. The text becomes a certain performance. But it allows for a wider audience to participate than I originally aimed for.I am not saying this is a better method. Rather I want this experience to show the issues with open access and giving people their space and time to share their stories their own way. At the very most, this project as it stands, is a catalyst for memory and thus sharing stories. I hope by attempting to build accessibility into this website, create downloadable versions, and thinking about open access, I am able to share this story to a wider audience. However, I know that there are many communities for whom this website will not reach. I have to accept that there is a certain amount of a feedback loop in the sharing of this project and the telling of stories. It is my hope though that others will find it and be driven to contribute or fork it and make it their own. Maybe, then, they can tell the stories that I have failed to find.</p>
<p>In many ways, what I did 'live' online that was most impactful was sharing in the Pembroke Facebook community. My book has comments mostly from me. Colleagues supported it, but never left feedback even if they read it. So people support the idea, but like most academic work, who really has time to read it/wants to?</p>
<p>Open access is difficult. Just because things are open does not mean they are easy to access. Because of copyright laws, I cannot reproduce everything. I can provide a bibliography, but that stuff may not be open to others. I am working from within a university, with access to databases.</p>
<p>People like to share - oral interviews can be limiting in a sense. (Importance of social media)</p>
<p>Aside from Github, I did not document my errors well. </p>
<p>__</p>
<p>I choose not follow the newspaper narrative fully. I challenge the ads that glorify companies by showing strikes. I also show the importance of local strikes more than the Daily Observer (ex. which barely talked about 1966 Eddy strike, focusing on rail.)</p>
<p>Digital soundscape: performative because I am storytelling with sound, based on the material history that is left over.</p>
<p>I aim for a bit of repetition in sentences, to drill home the closing down of industry as ubiquitous</p>
<p>I want the map to show the movement of place. A bit constrained digitally, but show how places move in a bit of chronology, highlight important places to show where resources came from, how close and important rail was for resources</p>
