<p>Historians must use the interdisciplinary knowledge available, while also offering the knowledge they have; it will make for a better approach to digital work because you will see it from all sorts of angle, able to break it apart better.</p>

<p>It feels to me as if our practise as humanists and historians is being driven by the technology, rather than being served by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are being driven by it only if we refuse to understand its structure and purpose and then critique it and our understanding of it. Hitchcock is trying to show that these tools have much longer histories entangled within them. Our job is not to un-entangle, but to understand these tools and the entanglement (We are trying to understand entanglement from within the entanglement).</p>

<p>There was an industrial revolution involving iron. There was a war in the 1860s and so on. 
What surprises me most, is that I am not more surprised.
In part, I suspect the banal character of most ngrams and network analyses is a reflection &gt;of the extent to which books, indexes, and text, have themselves been a very effective &gt;technology for thinking about words. </p>
<p>And that as long as we are using digital technology to re-examine text, we are going to have &gt;a hard time competing with two hundred years of library science, and humanist enquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to forget that these have years of evolution behind them, designed for reasons; we have to be careful not to over estimate ourselves and the 'digital revolution'. As Hitchcock notes in the first quote above, we have been trained in these methods because they work. This is not random. There are reasons we do these things. The positivist outlook we should also avoid that Hitchcock implies is that the digital is what we have been waiting for to 'crack' the proverbial humanist code. </p>
