                <p>The digital is an augmented reality in Stuart Eve's terms - that is, a user works in the "real world while visually receiving additional computer generated or modelled information." But even non-digital historical work is an augmented reality in itself since we approach the past by layering sources and drawing out a complex reality. Hitchcock wants us to understand that the way we approach historical work is sufficient in the non-digital realm as well. Yet the 'reality' is that we face digital tools often and should embrace them. We ought to, though, use our methods of critical thinking to critique the digital tools we use because of the history they themselves have. We must adjust these skills and learn new practices (ex. reading code) to continue our critiques.</p>

<p>The current collection of digital material that forms the basis for most of our research is &gt;composed of the maudlin leavings of rich dead white men (and some rich dead white women). &gt;Until we get around to including the non-cannonical, the non-Western, the non-textual and the &gt;non-elite, we are unlikely to be very surprised.</p>

<p>The digital reflects traditional practice. It is easy to become enamoured by digital data, simply if by the interface or what it means to have big historical data across the web in a variety of formats. But these sources <strong>can</strong> reproduce the same narratives, leading to little new insight.</p>

                <p>There is an element of augmented reality in the layers of these digital sources. A source code is emulated as an interface. It is easy, then, to get caught up in the habit of clicking and getting. Digital humanists must learn the dirty art of doing the work themselves, least seeing how it is constructed. As much as there are digital tools for historical data, we need tools to help us understand underlying code structures. For example, <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/goggles">Mozilla web goggles</a> that show the elements of a web page.</p>

                <p>Everything has a history. As Hitchcock notes, DH historicity = ideas of codebreaking and 'cracking' from the 20th century. We fall into those same tropes and traps. In my own work on sound studies, this is particularly true of my map: listening has a history formed by years of  recorded noise. (Though for Ingold this is not the case necessarily since we have a biological history as well.) Reproducing recorded sounds digitally just reinforces traditional means of historical study rather than challenging it</p>

<p>Confronted by people happy to define a point on the earth's surface as three simple numbers, &gt;and to claim that it was always so, was a shock. This is not to say that the archaeologists &gt;were being na√Øve, far from it, but that having been trained up as a text historian - &gt;essentially a textual critic - in those meetings I came face to face with the existence of a &gt;different kind of knowing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historians must use the interdisciplinary knowledge available, while also offering the knowledge they have; it will make for a better approach to digital work because you will see it from all sorts of angle, able to break it apart better.</p>

<p>We are being driven by it only if we refuse to understand its structure and purpose and then critique it and our understanding of it. Hitchcock is trying to show that these tools have much longer histories entangled within them. Our job is not to un-entangle, but to understand these tools and the entanglement (We are trying to understand entanglement from within the entanglement).</p>
